# Synthetic-3D-Speaking-Children
![](data/3.png)
The repo contains the methods for generating and and results of 3D speaking child data

In this work we have used synthetic child data which is generated using ChildGAN architecture. Child GAN is build by oerforming effcient fine-tuning in StyleGAN2. The complete experimental details of CHildGAN can be found in below repo
https://github.com/MAli-Farooq/ChildGAN

The next step includes generating child synthetic voiceover which is done via Fastspeech TTS

The last step includes generating Synthetic 3D child Data which is done via diffusion process. The compelete details can be found in provided link
